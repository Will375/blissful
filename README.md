# 😌 Blissful
Blissful is my attempt at the gamification of relaxation techniques through virtual reality. I came up with this project idea during the pandemic when I thought about how people were using Virtual Reality as an escape. However, I saw it was largely used for gaming.

I took it upon myself to pursue this idea through as my BSc dissertation. My game wouldn't involve the common themes of violence or competition, but instead focused on relaxation and mindfulness. I wanted to create a game that would help people relax and unwind, and I thought that gamifying relaxation techniques would be a good way to do this. I also wanted to create a game that would be accessible to everyone, so I decided to make it free and open source. 

I hope that this game will help people to relax and unwind, and that it will help people to be more mindful of their mental health.
