# Blissful
Blissful is my attempt at the gamification of relaxation techniques through virtual reality. This is my final year dissertation project. I came up with this project idea during the pandemic when I thought about how people were using Virtual Reality as an escape. However, I saw it was largely used for gaming. I took it upon myself to pursue a game that didn't involve violence or competition, but instead focused on relaxation and mindfulness. I wanted to create a game that would help people relax and unwind, and I thought that gamifying relaxation techniques would be a good way to do this. I also wanted to create a game that would be accessible to everyone, so I decided to make it free and open source. I hope that this game will help people to relax and unwind, and that it will help people to be more mindful of their mental health.
